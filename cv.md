### About me
------------

> iOS Development has become my main hobby in the last year when I randomly bought a book on Swift. Now my first app for the Appstore market almost done, but I don't want to stop learning. My wish is to participate in creating a big commercial app with a professional team. I think that a good app can a little bit change the world, it can help other people. 

> I believe that I will have amazing success in mobile development because I have: truly wishes, good career results in another profession (at the moment it is strategic position at Wargaming), gorgeous soft skills and constant affection to "how  it works".
